#  Hollywood Casino Claims They Do Not Support Gambling

When the Hollywood Casino in Perryville, Maryland opened their doors on October 6th, they were met with much fanfare. Many people were excited to see a new casino open in the area, as it would bring much-needed jobs and revenue to the region. However, not long after the casino opened, it found itself in the middle of a controversy.

The issue at hand is that while Hollywood Casino claims they are not a gambling establishment, they actually offer slot machines which many believe constitutes gambling. This has caused some people to accuse Hollywood Casino of hypocrisy and of falsely advertising themselves.

In response to these accusations, Hollywood Casino has released a statement saying that their slot machines are “entertainment devices” and not gambling ones. They also argue that because there is no betting involved, players are not risking any money and therefore it cannot be considered gambling.

Whether or not you agree with Hollywood Casino’s interpretation of what constitutes gambling is up for debate. However, what is clear is that this issue has caused a lot of controversy and has put the casino in a negative light.

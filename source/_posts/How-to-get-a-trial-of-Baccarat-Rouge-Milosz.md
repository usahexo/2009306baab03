#  How to get a trial of Baccarat Rouge Milosz

The first time I ever saw Baccarat Rouge Milosz was in the duty free shop at the airport. I was on my way to Paris for a work trip and needed a new fragrance. I had never heard of it before, but the bottle was beautiful so I decided to give it a try.

The fragrance is really unique. It's a mix of bergamot, rose, patchouli, and vanilla, and it smells amazing. Every time I wear it, I get compliments from strangers.

But the best part is that it's not too expensive. A bottle typically costs around $70, which is a lot cheaper than some of the other high-end fragrances on the market.

If you're looking for a new fragrance to try, I highly recommend Baccarat Rouge Milosz. You can find it at most department stores, or you can buy it online. And if you don't like it, you can always return it because it comes with a 30-day trial period.

#  Bottle blonde: The world's first ever Croatian red wine made from Plavac Mali grapes

For the red wine lovers, and for those who appreciate a good Croatia wine, we bring you bottle blonde. The world’s first ever Croatian red wine made from Plavac Mali grapes.

The wine is produced by the Jurić winery in Pakoštane, near Zadar. Bottle blonde is a dry, full-bodied red wine with 12% alcohol content. It has a deep ruby color and interesting fruity aroma with notes of blackberry, raspberry and currant.

Plavac Mali is a Croatian grape variety that grows almost exclusively on the Dalmatian coast. It is a cross between Zinfandel and Dobricic. The Plavac Mali grape gives wines high in tannins and alcohol, with flavors of blackberry, raspberry, cherry and pepper.

 Bottle blonde is the perfect wine to accompany grilled meats and cheeses, as well as pasta dishes with rich tomato sauce. It will also pair nicely with spicy dishes such as Thai green curry or Indian vindaloo.

Jurić winery has been making wine since 1898 and is now run by the fourth generation of the Jurić family. They use traditional methods to make their award-winning wines, including bottle blonde.

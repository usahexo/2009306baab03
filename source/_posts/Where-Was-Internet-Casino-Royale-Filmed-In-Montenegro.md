#  How Much Did It Cost To Film Casino Royale In Montenegro?

Casino Royale is a 2006 British spy film, the 21st film in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions. It is the sixth Bond film to star Daniel Craig as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond and was directed by Martin Campbell. The film's plot revolves around Bond seeking revenge against Le Chiffre, a French banker to whom he owes money, for funding terrorist groups.

Filming locations included the Czech Republic, Italy and the United Kingdom. However, much of the filming took place in Montenegro at Bar10 and Kotor Fortress. So how much did it cost to film Casino Royale in Montenegro?

The Daily Mail reports that it cost £25 million to shoot Casino Royale in Montenegro - making it the most expensive Bond movie ever made at that point. This breaks down to £2 million per week for the ten-week shoot.

A large chunk of this came from government subsidies - with Montenegro agreeing to contribute £13 million to filming in return for promotional exposure. This helped create around 1,000 jobs in the country and brought some much-needed tourism revenue.

In addition, Montenegro offered tax breaks and exemption from customs duties on goods bought for use during production. This was a major incentive for Eon Productions which had been looking at other locations including Malta and Hungary.

It's not clear exactly how much of Casino Royale was shot in Montenegro - some reports say it was as much as 80%. However, it's clear that the beautiful scenery and incentives offered by the country played a big role in attracting the production crew here.

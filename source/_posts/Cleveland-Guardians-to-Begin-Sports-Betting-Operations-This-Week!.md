#  Cleveland Guardians to Begin Sports Betting Operations This Week!

The Cleveland Guardians announced this week that they will start taking sports bets starting Wednesday, September 11th!

“This is a great day for the Cleveland Guardians and our fans!” said Guardians owner, David E. Hanna. “We are very excited to offer sports betting to our fans and believe it will be a popular addition to our game day experience.”

Guardians staff will be on hand at the betting windows starting at 11:00am on Wednesday to take bets on all of the day’s games. The team has also partnered with several local casinos who will offer complimentary parking and discounts to Guardians fans who visit their establishments on game days.

#  Cleveland Guardians Set Up Sports Betting Account in Minutes!

The Cleveland Guardians are a professional football team that play in the American Football League. They have been in the league since its inception in 1990. The team is based in Cleveland, Ohio and their home stadium is Veterans Stadium.

The Guardians are one of the most successful teams in the AFL, having won the championship four times. However, they have not enjoyed much success in recent years, having missed the playoffs for the past six seasons.

This offseason, the Guardians made some major changes to their coaching staff and roster. They hope these changes will lead to a return to glory in 2020.

One of the new additions to the team is cornerback Jalen Ramsey. Ramsey was drafted by the Los Angeles Rams with the fifth overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. He played three seasons for the Rams before being traded to the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2019.

Ramsey is a two-time Pro Bowler and was named First-Team All-Pro in 2018. He is considered one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL and should help strengthen Cleveland’s defense.

The Guardians also made a few tweaks to their offense this offseason. They signed wide receiver Amari Cooper to a four-year, $128 million contract. Cooper was drafted fourth overall by the Oakland Raiders in the 2015 NFL Draft. He has played four seasons for Oakland and one season for Dallas Cowboys.

Cooper is a three-time Pro Bowl selection and was named Second-Team All-Pro in 2018. He is a big, physical receiver who can make plays downfield. He should be a great weapon for quarterback Baker Mayfield this season.

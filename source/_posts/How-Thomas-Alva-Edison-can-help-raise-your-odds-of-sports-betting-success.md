#  Can Thomas Alva Edison help make you a winning sports bettor?

Most people know the story of Thomas Alva Edison - the famous inventor who developed the lightbulb. But what you might not know is that Edison also had a keen interest in gambling, and even developed a system for predicting the outcomes of sporting events.

Edison's system was based on a simple premise - that there is no such thing as luck in gambling. Instead, he believed that all outcomes are determined by probability, and that it is possible to calculate these probabilities accurately.

To use his system, Edison would first study the odds for each event. He would then identify any patterns in the results, and use this information to predict the outcome of future events.

While his system was far from perfect, it did have a surprisingly high success rate. In one study, Edison correctly predicted the outcome of 63 out of 100 horse races.

There's no doubt that Edison's system could be used to make winning sports bets. However, it takes time and practice to become good at using it. If you're willing to put in the work, then Thomas Alva Edison can definitely help make you a winning sports bettor.

Edison was more than just an inventor. He was a thinker, and he always looked at things from a different perspective. This helped him come up with some of the most useful inventions in history. If you are looking to improve your betting strategy, then you should learn from Edison’s approach to problem-solving.

1) Break down the problem

Edison always broke down problems into smaller pieces so that he could understand them better. When it came to betting, he would analyze each individual game and figure out which bets offered the best odds. He would also look at historical data to see how likely certain outcomes were. By taking things step by step, Edison was able to make smarter bets and increase his chances of winning.

2) Think outside the box

Edison was always willing to think outside the box and come up with new solutions. In fact, many of his inventions were a result of this approach. When it came to betting, Edison would come up with new strategies that no one else had thought of before. This gave him a competitive edge and helped him win more bets.

3) Be persistent

Edison never gave up on his inventions, even when they didn’t work the first time around. He kept trying until he found a solution that worked. When it came to betting, Edison was equally persistent. He would keep making bets until he found ones that were profitable. This persistence paid off and helped him win more money in the long run.

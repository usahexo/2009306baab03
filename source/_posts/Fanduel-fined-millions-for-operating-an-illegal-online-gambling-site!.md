#  Fanduel fined millions for operating an illegal online gambling site!

On July 26, 2018, the US Federal Trade Commission announced that it had reached a settlement with Fanduel, fining the company $6 million for operating an illegal online gambling site.

The FTC's complaint alleged that Fanduel was in violation of the federal Wire Act, which prohibits interstate gambling. Specifically, the FTC argued that Fanduel's use of paid employees to fantasy sports contests constituted illegal gambling.

Fanduel has denied any wrongdoing, and has stated that it will fight the charges. In a statement released shortly after the FTC's announcement, Fanduel said that it "believes that its past conduct was lawful."

This isn't the first time that Fanduel has been in hot water with the law. In 2017, the company agreed to pay $5 million to settle charges brought by New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman that it had engaged in false advertising and running an illegal gambling operation.

#  State sues Fanduel for violating online gambling laws!

The state of New York is suing Fanduel for violating online gambling laws, the Attorney General announced on Wednesday.

“Fanduel blatantly promotes and profits from daily fantasy sports betting contests that amount to illegal gambling under New York law,” Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement.

Schneiderman has been investigating the company for the past year.

In a lawsuit filed in New York County Supreme Court, Schneiderman alleges that Fanduel is illegally operating a “full scale casino” in the state. The lawsuit seeks to shut down the company’s operations and recoup damages.

“As we allege, Fanduel is nothing more than a well-funded online slingo parlor,” Schneiderman said. “Its games are designed to lure people into unlawful gambling, and its advertising blitz is squarely aimed at encouraging reckless bets. Daily fantasy sports are neither victimless entertainment nor harmless fun – they are actually a very real form of gambling that can lead to substantial financial losses for consumers.”

A spokesman for Fanduel said the company is reviewing the lawsuit and declined further comment.

#  How does Fanduel get away with online gambling?

Fanduel, the brainchild of two Ivy League graduates, has managed to create a billion dollar company in the online gambling industry. So how did they do it? And more importantly, what makes their business model legal when so many other online gambling operators have been shut down by the government?

The key to Fanduel’s success is that they don’t actually operate as a gambling site. Instead, they offer contests where users can compete against each other for cash prizes. These contests are perfectly legal, as they are considered games of skill rather than games of chance.

This distinction is critical, as the legality of online gambling is a highly debated topic. The US government has cracked down on many operators in the past, but Fanduel manages to stay one step ahead by cleverly avoiding any language that could be construed as gambling.

So how does Fanduel make money if they’re not actually taking bets? They charge a commission on entry fees for their contests, and this small fee is all that’s needed to turn a healthy profit. In addition, they also offer advertising space on their site, which drives even more revenue.

Overall, Fanduel is a testament to the power of innovation and creativity. By carving out a unique niche in the online gambling market, they’ve been able to build a billion dollar business and change the way we think about sports betting.

#  Is Fanduel breaking the law by offering online gambling?

Since the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act was passed in 2006, online gambling has been illegal in the United States. This act makes it illegal for banks and other financial institutions to process any gambling related transactions. So, does this mean that Fanduel is breaking the law by offering their daily fantasy sports contests to US citizens?

The answer to this question is a bit murky. The UIGEA does make online gambling illegal, but there are a few exceptions. One of these exceptions is for fantasy sports contests that meet certain criteria. These contests must be games of skill rather than games of chance, and they must have an element of prize money or something of tangible value at stake.

So, it could be argued that Fanduel is not breaking the law because their contests do meet these criteria. However, there are some who disagree with this interpretation. They argue that while fantasy sports may be considered a game of skill, it still involves some elements of chance and that therefore it should not be exempt from the UIGEA.

At this point, it is up to the courts to decide whether or not Fanduel is breaking the law. There have already been a few cases brought against them, but so far they have all been dismissed. It remains to be seen whether or not Fanduel will ultimately be found guilty of violating the UIGEA.

#  Why is Fanduel allowed to offer online gambling when it's technically illegal?

When you think of gambling, what comes to mind? Chances are good that you think about casinos, those large, glamorous buildings that seem to be everywhere in America. Slot machines and gaming tables line the hallowed halls, staffed by dealers in fancy uniforms waiting to take your money.

What you may not know is that casino gambling is actually illegal in most states. The only states where it's explicitly legal are Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware. In every other state, casino gambling is either expressly forbidden or regulated so heavily as to make it functionally unavailable.

So how is it that there are casinos all over the place? How is it that Fanduel can offer online gambling? The answer lies in an exemption known as the " Indian Gaming Regulatory Act ".

Enacted in 1988, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act allows Native American tribes to operate casinos on their reservations as long as the games offered are traditional forms of Indian gaming . This includes things like bingo and poker, but does not include slot machines or other typical casino games.

The act was passed with the intention of promoting economic development on Native American reservations . It has been successful in this regard, with many tribes using their casinos to generate revenue for education and other essential services.

The legality of online gambling is more ambiguous. The Federal Wire Act of 1961 makes it illegal to bet or gamble across state lines, but this law was written before the internet even existed . There have been a number of court cases trying to clarify the act's applicability to online gambling, but no clear consensus has emerged.

For now, Fanduel and other companies offering online gambling are operating in a legal gray area. They are not technically breaking any laws, but they are also not operating in states where casino gambling is expressly legal. This may eventually change as courts provide more clarity on the legality of online gambling , but for now this industry remains something of a Wild West

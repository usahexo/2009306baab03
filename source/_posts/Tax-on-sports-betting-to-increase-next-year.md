#  Tax on sports betting to increase next year

The government is set to increase the taxes on sports betting from the start of next year, in a bid to boost revenue.

Currently, gambling tax is levied at a rate of 15%, but this is set to be increased to 20% from January 1st.

This move is likely to rake in an additional £500 million for the Treasury over the next five years.

The government has been looking for ways to increase revenue in light of the looming Brexit deadline, and this seems to be one way of doing so.

Minister for Sport Tracey Crouch said: “We are increasing the rate of gambling tax because we want to ensure that those who make money from gambling contribute a fair amount towards the cost of supporting people with problem gambling.”

The gambling industry has welcomed the news, with spokesman Matt Zarb-Cousin saying: “This is a responsible and proportionate measure that will help reduceproblem gambling and protect vulnerable people.”

However, some Opposition MPs have criticised the move, saying that it will hit low-income gamblers hardest.

#  Officials working to finalize tax rates for sports betting profits

States are currently racing to finalize the tax rates for sports betting profits, as many see the potential for significant new revenue sources. 

Governors in states such as Kentucky, Illinois, and New York have all voiced support for legalizing and taxing sports betting, and multiple bills have been introduced in Congress on the topic. While there is bipartisan support for taxation, there is also disagreement over how high the rates should be.

Supporters of higher taxes argue that sports betting should be taxed at a higher rate than other forms of gambling, in order to account for the increased risk associated with it. They note that many gamblers will bet on sports even when the odds are not in their favor, and that this behavior can have negative consequences for society as a whole.

Opponents of high taxes argue that they will discourage people from engaging in legal sports betting, and that this will lead to an increase in illegal activity. They also contend that taxes should not be higher than those on other forms of gambling, such as casino games or lottery tickets.

The final tax rates for sports betting profits are still being ironed out, but it is clear that these activities will be taxed at a much higher rate than traditional forms of gambling. This is likely to ensure that states receive significant new revenue from sports betting, while also discouraging illegal activity.

#  Sports Betting Tax Rates Called Into Question

Sports betting is one of the fastest-growing industries in the United States, with more and more states legalizing the activity. But as this new industry grows, so do questions about the appropriate tax rates to charge bettors.

The gambling industry is notoriously complex, and different types of gambling are taxed at different rates. For example, Nevada charges a 6.75% tax on casino gaming revenue, while Oregon charges just 17%.

States that have legalized sports betting are wrestling with how to tax it. The simplest solution would be to tax bookmakers at the same rate as casinos, but many states are hesitant to do that because of the sheer volume of sports bets that are placed. It's estimated that Nevada's taxable gaming revenue from sports bets is only about 2% of the total amount wagered, so a 6.75% tax on that revenue would generate only a tiny fraction of what states could bring in by taxing all wagers.

Some lawmakers are pushing for a much lower tax rate on sports betting, or even no tax at all. They argue that sports betting is a form of entertainment, like going to the movies or watching football on TV, and should not be subject to taxation.

Others counter that sports betting is an investment, similar to trading stocks or buying property, and should be taxed accordingly. They note that many professional athletes earn their income through endorsements and other contractual payments, not through their performance on the field; similarly, people who bet on sports shouldn't be penalized for their investment choices.

State officials are still trying to figure out the best way to tax sports betting, and no consensus has been reached yet. As the industry continues to grow, this issue is likely to come up again and again in state legislatures across the country.

#  Bets Likely to Come with Higher Taxes Starting Next Year

As the year comes to a close, taxpayers are already preparing themselves for the inevitable changes in their tax bracket come January. While there is still much unknown about the new administration’s tax plan, there are a few things we can be certain of. Namely, that tax rates are going up for high earners and that many deductions will disappear.

For those in the top income brackets, this could mean a significant increase in what they owe Uncle Sam next year. If you’re among this group, it’s important to start planning now for how these changes will impact your finances. Here are a few bets you can make to ensure you’re paying the least amount of taxes possible starting next year:

1) Max out your 401k contributions – One of the best ways to reduce your taxable income is to contribute to a 401k plan. The money you contribute is not taxed until you withdraw it, and since contributions are capped at $18,000 for 2017, there’s no reason not to take advantage of this deduction.

2) Convert some of your income into Roth IRA contributions – For those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, converting some of their pre-tax income into Roth IRA contributions can be a wise move. This allows you to pay taxes on the money now when your tax rate is lower, rather than later when you may be in a higher bracket.

3) Invest in municipal bonds – Another way to reduce your taxable income is by investing in municipal bonds. These bonds offer tax-free interest payments, making them a popular choice for high earners.

4) Consider doing a Roth conversion – A Roth conversion allows you to change some of your pre-tax retirement savings into post-tax Roth savings. While this move can come with some hefty tax implications, it can be well worth it if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

5) Make use of itemized deductions – Many itemized deductions will disappear next year under the new administration’s tax plan. However, there are still several deductions available for those who choose to itemize their taxes. Some popular ones include property taxes and charitable donations.

#  Nassau County officials weigh in on taxing sports betting

In the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling in May that opened the door for states to legalize sports betting, local officials are debating whether Nassau County should impose a tax on it.

The county legislature is considering a proposal that would levy a 10 percent tax on all bets made at sportsbooks in the county. The estimated $5 million in annual revenue from the tax would help fund infrastructure projects and other initiatives.

Nassau County Executive Laura Curran supports the proposal, saying that it would provide much-needed revenue for the county. She also believes that it would help keep gambling out of residential areas and away from children.

Others, including some legislators, object to the proposed tax, arguing that it would be unfair to those who bet on sports. They maintain that legalizing and taxing sports betting would simply encourage more people to gamble, and that the money raised from such a tax would not be enough to offset any potential negative impacts.

As lawmakers debate how best to proceed, they must weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of taxing sports betting in Nassau County.

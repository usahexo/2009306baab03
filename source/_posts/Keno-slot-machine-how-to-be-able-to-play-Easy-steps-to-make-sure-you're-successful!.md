The premise of keno is very simple -- you are trying to match numbers drawn at random from a large pool. The more numbers you match, the bigger your payout will be. To begin the game, you first need to place a bet on one or more of the 80 available spots on the keno ticket. Once you have placed your bet, the casino will then draw 20 numbers (or "balls") at random from a pool of 80 numbers. Your goal is to match as many of these numbers as possible.

If you match between four and ten numbers, you will win a prize based on how many numbers you matched and the size of your bet. If you match all 20 numbers, you will win the jackpot! In addition, there are also several different types of bets that you can place in keno. These include:

There is no doubt that Keno is one of the most exciting casino games to play. When you know how to play and get ahead of the competition, the excitement only intensifies. Here are some tips to help you on your way!

Understand the Odds

Before you even begin playing, it’s important to understand the odds. This will give you a good idea of how much you can expect to win (or lose). In Keno, each number has its own odds which are based on how many spots are selected. The more spots that are chosen, the lower the odds become for each number. For example, if you select 4 numbers and they are all hit, your winnings will be multiplied by 4. However, if only 1 of your 4 numbers is hit, your winnings will be much lower.

Choose Your Numbers Wisely

You don’t have to pick all 20 numbers if you don’t want to – in fact, this is rarely ever done. Most players choose around 7-10 numbers. This gives you a good chance of winning without increasing your odds too much. If there are a lot of people playing at the same machine as you, it may be wise to avoid picking common numbers like ‘1’ or ‘2’. Instead, try selecting some less common numbers that nobody else is likely to choose.

Bet the Maximum Amount

When it comes to Keno, betting the maximum amount always gives you the best chance of winning! This doesn’t mean that you will automatically win – but it does increase your chances significantly. So if you have a few dollars extra to spare, bet them all on one game rather than spreading them out over multiple games.

        <h1 id="Online-gambling-may-be-legal-in-the-US-after-all"><a href="#Online-gambling-may-be-legal-in-the-US-after-all" class="headerlink" title="Online gambling may be legal in the US after all!"></a>Online gambling may be legal in the US after all!</h1><p>Online gambling in the United States may be legal after all, following a recent decision by the Supreme Court to strike down a law that bans it.</p>
<p>The law in question, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA), prohibited states from allowing sports betting, with just a handful of exceptions. But the Supreme Court ruled on Monday that this was unconstitutional, as it violated states’ rights to make their own decisions.</p>
<p>This means that each state will now be free to decide whether or not to allow online gambling within its borders. And it’s likely that many will do so, given that there is estimated to be $150 billion bet illegally on sports every year in the US.</p>
<p>Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey have already been offering some form of legal online gambling since 2013, 2017 and 2018 respectively. But now that PASPA has been struck down, it’s likely that many more states will follow suit.</p>
<p>This is great news for online gamblers in the US, who have had little choice but to use offshore sites in order to place bets. These sites are often unregulated and can be risky to use, so being able to gamble legally within the US is definitely a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how things develop over the coming months and years as different states decide whether or not to allow online gambling. Hopefully, this new development will lead to a more regulated and safer environment for online gamblers in the US.</p>
<h1 id="Supreme-Court-agrees-to-hear-New-Jersey’s-case-on-online-gambling"><a href="#Supreme-Court-agrees-to-hear-New-Jersey’s-case-on-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Supreme Court agrees to hear New Jersey’s case on online gambling"></a>Supreme Court agrees to hear New Jersey’s case on online gambling</h1><p>After the state of New Jersey was unable to get the United States Supreme Court to hear its case on online gambling in early 2018, state officials were pleased to announce that the nation’s highest court had agreed to hear the case in October of the same year.</p>
<p>This was great news for New Jersey and its efforts to legalize online gambling within the state, with officials stating that they were confident that the Supreme Court would see the merits of their argument and rule in their favor.</p>
<p>The case pits New Jersey against three other states – Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio – who have all passed laws banning online gambling within their borders.</p>
<p>New Jersey has been fighting for years to overturn these bans, arguing that they are unconstitutional and go against both the Tenth Amendment (which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states) and the Commerce Clause (which prohibits state laws from unduly burdening interstate commerce).</p>
<p>The argument is a strong one, and many people feel that New Jersey is likely to win when the case goes before the Supreme Court in October. This could open up the floodgates for other states looking to legalize online gambling, as well as for operators who want to offer such services.</p>
<h1 id="Online-gambling-is-now-a-reality-in-the-US"><a href="#Online-gambling-is-now-a-reality-in-the-US" class="headerlink" title="Online gambling is now a reality in the US"></a>Online gambling is now a reality in the US</h1><p>Today, online gambling is legal in three US states: Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey. More states are considering legalizing it, including California which is expected to have a referendum on the issue in November.</p>
<p>Legalizing online gambling has been a long time coming. Supporters say that it would generate tax revenue and create jobs. Opponents argue that it would lead to increased addiction and social problems.</p>
<p>Nevada was the first state to legalize online gambling in 2013. At the time, there were concerns about how the new law would be implemented and whether it would be successful. However, those concerns have been allayed by the fact that Nevada’s online gambling industry is thriving. In fact, Nevada’s online casinos took in more than $ transacted in 2017.</p>
<p>Delaware was the second state to legalize online gambling and it has seen similar success. In 2017, online gambling generated over $ million in revenue for Delaware’s casinos.</p>
<p>New Jersey was the third state to legalize online gambling and it has also seen strong growth. In 2017, New Jersey’s online casinos generated over $ million in revenue. That’s a substantial increase from 2016 when they generated only $ million.</p>
<p>All three of these states have seen an increase in tourism because of their legalized online gambling industries. People are now traveling specifically to gamble online in these states. This has led to an increase in overall tax revenue as well as job creation.</p>
<p>It’s clear that legalized online gambling is a success story thus far. More states should consider legalizing it as it could provide a major boost to their economies.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Nevada-and-New-Jersey-partner-to-offer-online-gambling"><a href="#Delaware-Nevada-and-New-Jersey-partner-to-offer-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware, Nevada and New Jersey partner to offer online gambling"></a>Delaware, Nevada and New Jersey partner to offer online gambling</h1><p>Three American states, Delaware, Nevada and New Jersey have partnered to allow their residents to gamble online. The agreement allows players in each state to bet on casino games, including poker, across all three states.</p>
<p>The deal is seen as a major step forward in the development of online gambling in the United States. The move follows similar agreements between states in Europe and paves the way for more widespread cross-border gambling in future.</p>
<p>Delaware and Nevada first announced their plan to offer online gambling jointly in February of this year. At the time, the two states said they were seeking a partner state with a population size similar to their own. New Jersey was subsequently chosen as that partner state due to its population of nearly 9 million people.</p>
<p>All three states will now work together to develop shared regulations for online gambling. This will include defining what games can be played, setting minimum age requirements and establishing tax rates. Players in each state will also be able to access websites operated by casinos in the other two states.</p>
<p>“This is an important day for fans of Internet gaming and for the industry as a whole,” said Jennifer Roberts, senior vice president at South Point Casino, which operates an online site in partnership with Station Casinos LLC. “This agreement creates opportunities for us to collaborate on player protections while allowing our customers access to our products through one convenient website.”</p>
<p>The launch of online gambling across Delaware, Nevada and New Jersey is scheduled for autumn of this year.</p>
<h1 id="Could-this-be-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-prohibition-of-online-gambling"><a href="#Could-this-be-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-prohibition-of-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Could this be the beginning of the end for prohibition of online gambling?"></a>Could this be the beginning of the end for prohibition of online gambling?</h1><p>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has handed down a new opinion that could signal the beginning of the end for the prohibition of online gambling.</p>
<p>In what is being hailed as a “landmark decision”, the DOJ has ruled that the Wire Act only applies to sports betting, and not to other forms of gambling such as casino games and poker.</p>
<p>While this doesn’t mean that online gambling is now legal in the US, it does open the door for individual states to regulate and licence online gaming within their own borders.</p>
<p>This is a major development given that the US is one of the biggest markets for online gambling, and could pave the way for other countries to follow suit.</p>
<p>The news was greeted with joy by the online gambling industry, with shares in major companies such as PokerStars and William Hill surging on the news.</p>
<p>However, it was met with dismay by anti-gambling campaigners who argue that it will lead to more problem gambling and social harm.</p>
<p>So what does this ruling mean for Online Gambling? And more importantly, what does it mean for you?</p>
<p>Well, firstly it’s important to understand that this ruling only applies to interstate gambling transactions. That means that you can still not gamble on overseas websites from within the United States.</p>
<p>Secondly, this ruling only applies to casino games, poker and other table games. It does not apply to sports betting, which is still illegal under federal law.</p>
<p>That means that if you live in a state where online gambling is licensed and regulated, you will be able to play games like blackjack, roulette or craps without fear of prosecution. However, if you try to gamble on an unlicensed site or outside your state’s borders, you could still be prosecuted.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for the future of online gambling? Well, it’s too early to tell at this stage. But what it does do is open up the possibility for states to license and regulate their own online casinos, which could lead to a more liberalised approach to online gambling in years to come.</p>

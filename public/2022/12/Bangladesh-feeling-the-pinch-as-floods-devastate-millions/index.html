<p>Heavy rains and flash flooding since early July have killed more than 130 people and affected nearly 16 million, according to the country’s disaster management agency.</p>
<p>More than 700,000 people have been displaced, many of them living in makeshift camps or shelters.</p>
<p>Aid agencies are warning of a potential humanitarian crisis as the waters start to recede, leaving vast areas littered with rotting carcasses of livestock and submerged crops.</p>
<p>“The scale of the devastation is unprecedented,” said Adnan Khan, head of the Bangladesh office of Care International.</p>
<p>“People are struggling to survive with little or no access to food, clean water or shelter.”</p>
<p>The UN Children’s Fund (Unicef) said it was particularly worried about the fate of some 400,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees who have fled violence in neighbouring Myanmar and are living in makeshift camps near the border.</p>
<p>Many of those camps have been flooded, Unicef said.</p>

The money will be used to help the country recover from the devastation caused by the recent floods.</p>
<p>“This historic assistance will help millions of Bangladeshi families as they continue to rebuild their lives in the aftermath of this devastating disaster,” said US Ambassador Marcia Bernicat.</p>
<p>The aid package includes money for food, shelter, and medical assistance. It will also be used to help rebuild homes and critical infrastructure that was damaged by the floods.</p>
<p>Bangladesh has been struggling to recover from the floods that have killed more than 1,000 people and displaced millions. The US aid package will provide much-needed assistance to the country as it tries to rebuild.</p>
<h1 id="Bangladesh-on-high-alert-after-militants-threaten-new-attacks"><a href="#Bangladesh-on-high-alert-after-militants-threaten-new-attacks" class="headerlink" title="Bangladesh on high alert after militants threaten new attacks"></a>Bangladesh on high alert after militants threaten new attacks</h1><p>Bangladesh is on high alert after the government received threats of new attacks from militant groups. The High- Security Printing Press in Dhaka, which prints banknotes and other sensitive documents, has been shut down for security reasons.</p>
<p>Police have stepped up security across the country, and are asking the public to be vigilant. In a statement, the government said that it had “received information that some terrorist groups are planning to carry out subversive activities in different parts of the country in near future.”</p>
<p>The increased security comes after a series of deadly attacks claimed by Islamist militants in Bangladesh over the past year. In July 2016, militants stormed a popular restaurant in Dhaka’s diplomatic district, killing 22 people, most of them foreigners.</p>
<p>In October 2016, militants killed three people when they exploded bombs at a religious festival in Kishoreganj district. In March this year, militants killed two police officers during a raid on a house in Dhaka.</p>
<p>The government has blamed the militant group Islamic State (IS) for carrying out these attacks. However, domestic opposition parties have accused the government of failing to protect civilians and of not doing enough to prevent Islamist extremism from spreading in the country.</p>
<h1 id="Bangladesh-ranked-one-of-the-world’s-most-corrupt-countries"><a href="#Bangladesh-ranked-one-of-the-world’s-most-corrupt-countries" class="headerlink" title="Bangladesh ranked one of the world’s most corrupt countries"></a>Bangladesh ranked one of the world’s most corrupt countries</h1><p>Bangladesh has been ranked one of the world’s most corrupt countries by Transparency International, placing at 176th out of 177 countries. The report, released on Wednesday, stated that corruption in Bangladesh is rampant and that the institutions responsible for tackling graft are ineffective.</p>
<p>“The state institutions are weak and lack independence,” said Muhammad Mosharraf Hossain, Transparency International’s Bangladesh representative. “The Anti-corruption Commission is not effective and there is no will among the politicians to fight corruption.”</p>
<p>According to the report, people in Bangladesh have to pay bribes for a wide range of services, including accessing government information or utilities, getting jobs or contracts, and even receiving medical treatment. Corruption also costs the country millions of dollars every year in lost revenue.</p>
<p>In response to the report, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina promised that her government would take more action against corruption. “We will take stringent actions against those who are involved in graft… We want a graft-free society and we will achieve it,” she said.</p>
<p>However, many doubt her government’s ability or willingness to address the issue. “Politicians across the board are implicated in corruption and it is unlikely that they will be willing to change things,” said Iftekhar Zaman, executive director of Transparency International-Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Bangladesh is not the only South Asian country to rank poorly on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). India ranks 79th out of 177 countries, while Pakistan ranks 116th and Sri Lanka ranks 94th.</p>

Over the past decade, the city has experienced rapid economic growth, and its port has become an important transit point for goods entering and leaving Asia.</p>
<p>This growth has been fueled by a number of factors, including Dhaka’s strategic location at the intersection of major shipping routes, its well-developed infrastructure, and its growing population. The city’s economy is also supported by a large informal sector, which employs millions of people in a wide range of activities.</p>
<p>A number of foreign companies have recently established operations in Dhaka, drawn by the city’s booming economy and its large pool of skilled labor. As a result, Dhaka is now home to some of the largest multinationals in the world.</p>
<p>The city’s thriving economy is attracting increasing numbers of tourists, who are drawn to its vibrant culture and affordable prices. In addition, Dhaka is becoming an increasingly popular destination for students seeking quality education at an affordable cost.</p>
<p>Dhaka is quickly emerging as a major center for global trade and commerce. Its well-developed infrastructure and large population make it an attractive location for businesses and investors alike. The city’s vibrant culture and affordable prices are also attracting increasing numbers of tourists and students.</p>

      How has Milosz fared with the Pelicans

        <h1 id="How-has-Milosz-fared-with-the-Pelicans"><a href="#How-has-Milosz-fared-with-the-Pelicans" class="headerlink" title="How has Milosz fared with the Pelicans?"></a>How has Milosz fared with the Pelicans?</h1><p>Since being traded to the Pelicans, Milosz has been a valuable player for the team. In his first game with the Pelicans, he came off the bench and scored 16 points in just 15 minutes of playing time. This helped the Pelicans secure a win against one of their division rivals.</p>
<p>Since then, Milosz has continued to be a key contributor for the Pelicans. He has averaged 13 points and 5 rebounds per game. This is especially important considering that the Pelicans are missing some of their top players due to injury.</p>
<p>One area where Milosz has struggled is with his shooting percentage. He is currently shooting only 39% from the field. However, he has been able to make up for this by getting to the free throw line frequently. He is averaging 5 free throw attempts per game.</p>
<p>The Pelicans are currently in 7th place in the Western Conference with a record of 33-26. If they can continue to play this well, they have a good chance of making it into the playoffs. Milosz will be an important part of their success as he continues to provide solid production off the bench.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-Milosz’s-thoughts-on-the-new-season"><a href="#What-are-Milosz’s-thoughts-on-the-new-season" class="headerlink" title="What are Milosz’s thoughts on the new season?"></a>What are Milosz’s thoughts on the new season?</h1><p>There are mixed reactions to the new season of “House of Cards” on Milosz’s social media feeds. Some say that it’s not as good as previous seasons, while others claim that it’s just as good, if not better.</p>
<p>Milosz himself has yet to offer an opinion on the matter, but given his well-known love for the show, it’s safe to assume that he’s enjoying it. He has, however, offered some thoughts on what he expects from the rest of the season.</p>
<p>“I’m really excited for the rest of the season,” Milosz says. “I think it’s going to be really interesting to see how things play out now that Frank is no longer in power.”</p>
<p>He also believes that Claire is going to be a much more central character this season, which should make for an interesting storyline. Overall, Milosz is excited to see where the show goes and hopes that it doesn’t disappoint.</p>
<h1 id="What-adjustments-has-Milosz-made-to-his-game-since-arriving-in-New-Orleans"><a href="#What-adjustments-has-Milosz-made-to-his-game-since-arriving-in-New-Orleans" class="headerlink" title="What adjustments has Milosz made to his game since arriving in New Orleans?"></a>What adjustments has Milosz made to his game since arriving in New Orleans?</h1><p>Milosz has made a few adjustments to his game since arriving in New Orleans. One of the most notable changes has been his increased focus on 3-point shooting. Milosz is now taking more than five threes per game, up from less than three attempts per contest last season. His percentage from beyond the arc has also improved, as he is shooting over 38 percent from deep this year compared to just over 33 percent last year.</p>
<p>Another adjustment that Milosz has made is his defensive effort. He has been much more active on the defensive end, averaging over one steal and one block per game. This effort has helped the Pelicans limit their opponents to just 99.8 points per 100 possessions, which ranks sixth in the NBA.</p>
<p>Lastly, Milosz has also been more aggressive attacking the basket this season. He is averaging nearly six free throw attempts per game, up from just over four last year. This increase in aggressiveness has resulted in him scoring more points in the paint and drawing more fouls.</p>
<h1 id="What-do-the-Pelicans-need-to-improve-upon-to-make-a-postseason-run"><a href="#What-do-the-Pelicans-need-to-improve-upon-to-make-a-postseason-run" class="headerlink" title="What do the Pelicans need to improve upon to make a postseason run?"></a>What do the Pelicans need to improve upon to make a postseason run?</h1><p>The New Orleans Pelicans reached the postseason for the first time since 2011 last year. Led by Anthony Davis, Jrue Holiday, and Nikola Mirotic, the Pelicans were one game away from reaching the Western Conference Finals. However, there are several areas in which they need to improve in order to make a run at the title this year.</p>
<p>To start, the Pelicans need to find a way to improve their defense. They allowed 111.7 points per game last year, which was 22nd in the NBA. In addition, they need to find a way to get more out of their bench. Their bench averaged just 27 points per game last year, which was 26th in the league.</p>
<p>Finally, they need to develop better chemistry. The Pelicans got off to a rocky start last year, but they were able to turn things around and make a run at the playoffs. If they can start the season strong this year, it will give them a lot of confidence going forward.</p>
<h1 id="How-much-longer-will-Milosz-be-with-the-Pelicans"><a href="#How-much-longer-will-Milosz-be-with-the-Pelicans" class="headerlink" title="How much longer will Milosz be with the Pelicans?"></a>How much longer will Milosz be with the Pelicans?</h1><p>It is no secret that the New Orleans Pelicans are a team on the rise. Led by superstar Anthony Davis, the Pelicans have made it to the playoffs in each of the past two seasons. This past offseason, they made a blockbuster deal to acquire DeMarcus Cousins from the Sacramento Kings.</p>
<p>While Cousins is known for being a volatile player, he gives New Orleans a formidable frontcourt duo with Davis. The addition of Cousins has many people believing that the Pelicans could make it to the NBA Finals this season.</p>
<p>However, one question that still looms is how long will Milosz be with the team?</p>
<p>Milosz was acquired by the Pelicans in a trade with the Denver Nuggets in February of this year. He has been a key contributor for New Orleans off the bench, averaging 7.5 points and 4.2 rebounds per game.</p>
<p>Prior to coming to New Orleans, Milosz had played his entire career with the Nuggets. He was drafted by Denver in 2012 and had been a consistent member of their rotation ever since.</p>
<p>Given his history with Denver, it is understandable that Milosz may want to return there once he becomes a free agent this summer. The Nuggets are a young team on the rise, and Milosz could be an important piece of their future.</p>
<p>New Orleans may try to re-sign Milosz this summer, but they may not be able to match what Denver offers him financially. If Milosz leaves New Orleans, they will likely need to find another backup center for DeMarcus Cousins.</p>
